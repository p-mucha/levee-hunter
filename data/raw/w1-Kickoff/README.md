This is the student kickoff package provided to us even before the project started, but I marked it as w1 (week 1). 
It contains:
1. a 1 degree square tile of LiDAR (elevation) data for Sacramento in the US (“N38W122.tif”), as it appears to contain a lot of known levees.
2. a geo-package (“us_levees_n38w122.gpkg”) that describes the 230 levees that exist in this region.
